# Overview

> **Important Note**
>
> Jar3d has undergone a complete overhaul. The neo4j feature has been temporarily removed and will be reintroduced in a future release.

## Supported Servers and Models

- **openai** (Recommended)
  - Models:
    - `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`
    - `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`

- **anthropic**
  - Supported, but not recommended for use

## About Jar3d

Jar3d is a Meta Agent built on LangGraph, designed to orchestrate a team of agents for completing basic tasks.

The agent team includes:

- Google Search Agent
- Google Shopping Agent
- Web Scraper Agent
- RAG Agent

**The agent team can be extended by adding additional tool using agents to the project.**

> **Important Note**
>
> If you are extending the agent team, you must have a `meta_agent` and a `reporter_agent` in the team.

Jar3d can perform basic tasks like product sourcing, writing newsletters, creating itineraries, and essentially anything that can be reasonably done with the team of agents listed above.

## Core Concepts

Jar3d functions as a meta-agent system, orchestrating various agents to achieve complex goals. The system comprises four primary agent types:

1. **Meta Agent**: Central orchestrator coordinating other agents' activities.
2. **Tool Agent**: Interfaces with specific tools or services for specialized tasks.
3. **Reporter Agent**: Communicates results and updates to the user.
4. **Requirements Gathering Agent**: Refines and clarifies project requirements through user interaction.

### Key Techniques

- **Meta Prompting**: Leverages advanced prompting techniques for improved performance.
- **Chain of Reasoning**: Adapts the Chain-of-Reasoning approach for more coherent outputs.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances responses with relevant contextual information.
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Creates comprehensive knowledge graphs from web pages.

### System Workflow

1. Users interact with the Requirements Gathering Agent to define project goals.
2. Finalized requirements are passed to the Meta Agent.
3. The Meta Agent orchestrates Tool Agents to accomplish the goal.
4. Results are passed to the Reporter Agent for user communication.

## Prerequisites

1. Git
2. Docker and Docker Compose

## Configuration

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brainqub3/meta_expert.git
   cd meta_expert
   ```

2. Configure `config/config.yaml`:
   - Set API keys for chosen LLM providers (Serper, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Groq)
   - Choose inference provider by setting `LLM_SERVER` (e.g., claude, openai, groq)

**Note**: Keep your `config.yaml` file private as it contains sensitive information.

## Setup

### Confgurations

Setup the configurations for the project in the `config/config.yaml` file.

- **Serper API Key:** Get it from [https://serper.dev/](https://serper.dev/)
- **OpenAI API Key:** Get it from [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)- Advised Model
- **Gemini API Key:** Get it from [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) - Not currently supported
- **Claude API Key:** Get it from [https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started)
- **Groq API Key:** Get it from [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) - Not currently supported

### Docker Setup

1. Ensure Docker daemon is running.
2. Build and start containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access Jar3d web interface at `http://localhost:8105`.

To stop the service:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Usage

1. Access the Jar3d web interface.
2. Jar3d will introduce itself and ask questions to refine your requirements.
3. Type `/end` when you've provided all relevant information.
4. Submit feedback using the `/feedback` tag.

## Roadmap

- Integration with Ollama, vLLM, and other LLM providers
- Enhanced memory management
- Improved document processing and RAG capabilities
