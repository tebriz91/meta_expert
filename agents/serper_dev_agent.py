    # Functionality:
    This agent performs Google web searches based on a list of queries you provide. It returns a formatted list of organic search results, including the query, title, link, and sitelinks for each result.

    ## Inputs:
    - **queries**: A list of search query strings.
    - **location**: Geographic location code for the search (e.g., 'us', 'gb', 'nl', 'ca'). Defaults to 'us'.

    ## Outputs:
    - A formatted string representing the organic search engine results page (SERP), including:
        - Query
        - Title
        - Link
        - Sitelinks

    ## When to Use:
    - When you need to retrieve search engine results for specific queries.
    - When you require URLs from search results for further investigation.

    ## Important Notes:
    - This tool **only** provides search result summaries; it does **not** access or retrieve content from the linked web pages.
    - To obtain detailed content or specific information from the web pages listed in the search results, you should use the **WebScraperAgent** or the **OfflineRAGWebsearchAgent** with the URLs obtained from this tool.

    ## Example Workflow:
    1. **Search**: Use this agent with queries like `["latest advancements in AI"]`.
    2. **Retrieve URLs**: Extract the list of URLs from the search results.
    3. **Deep Dive**:
        - Use web scraping with the extracted URLs to get the full content of the pages.
        - Use RAG to extract specific data from web pages.

    # Remember
    You should provide the inputs as suggested.
