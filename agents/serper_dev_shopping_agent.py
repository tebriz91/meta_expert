    """
    # Functionality:
    This agent performs Google Shopping searches based on a list of queries you provide. It returns a formatted list of shopping results, including the title, price, source, rating, and link for each result.

    ## Inputs:
    - **queries**: A list of shopping query strings.
    - **location**: Geographic location code for the search (e.g., 'us', 'gb', 'nl', 'ca'). Defaults to 'us'.

    ## Outputs:
    - A formatted string representing the shopping search results, including:
        - Title
        - Source
        - Price
        - Rating
        - Delivery
        - Link

    ## When to Use:
    - When you need to retrieve product information from Google Shopping for specific queries.
    - When you require product details such as price, rating, and source.

    ## Important Notes:
    - This tool **only** provides shopping result summaries; it does **not** access or retrieve content from the linked web pages.
    - To obtain detailed content or specific information from the product pages, you should use the **WebScraperAgent** or the **OfflineRAGWebsearchAgent** with the URLs obtained from this tool.

    # Remember
    You should provide the inputs as suggested.
