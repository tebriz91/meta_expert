    """
    # Functionality:
    This agent extracts **specific information** from web pages by processing them using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Use this tool when you need precise answers or data related to particular queries from web pages.

    ## Inputs:
        - **url**: The URL of the web page to process.
        - **query**: The specific question or topic to search for within the web page.

    You can provide multiple url-query pairs.

    ## Outputs:
    - A JSON-formatted string containing the specific information retrieved from each webpage, along with its corresponding URL.

    ## When to Use:
    - When you need to extract specific pieces of information or answers to particular questions from web pages.
    - After obtaining URLs and needing targeted information from those pages.

    ## Important Notes:
    - This tool processes the content of each URL to find information relevant to the provided query.
    - It is more efficient than web scraping when you only need specific data rather than the entire page content.

    ## Example Workflow:
    1. **Get URLs**: Get the search engine results page (SERP).
    2. **Define Queries**: Formulate specific queries for the information you need from each URL.
    3. **Extract Information**: Use this agent to retrieve targeted information.

    # Remember
    You should provide the inputs as suggested.
